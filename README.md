# RecipeBook Angular Miniproject

This is a simple miniproject I'm doing following an Angular course ( [Angular - The Complete Guide (2021 Edition) by Maximilian Schwarzmüller](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/) ).

The miniproject is rather basic but I am doing it to refresh my Angular skills and to possibly improve and fill basic knowledge gaps I may have.

I did follow the basic structure of the project presented in the course, so many aspects of this one are just taken from that, the biggest differences being the implementation of the NGRX store and the use bootstrap.
\
\
The course used the old NGRX syntax (pre version 8), I used instead the new raccomented one (alongside other changes like using fascade services instead of communicating directly with the store).
\
\
About bootstra, during the course the instructor uses Boostrap version 3, I decided to go with version 4 instead and adapt what he implements using version 3 in version 4, so that this can just help me play around and familiarize a bit more with boostrap (css framework which I am only vaguely familiar with).
\
\
I've worked with Angular for around a year before starting this course and there are a few basic things I did not know, I thought it'd be worthwhile to document them, so I created a [Basic (likely less-known) Angular Interesting Facts document](./extra/basic_facts.md).
