# RecipeBook Angular Miniproject

This is a simple miniproject I'm doing following an Angular course ( [Angular - The Complete Guide (2020 Edition) by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/) ).

The miniproject looks a bit rather basic but I am doing it to refresh my Angular skills and to possibly improve and fill basic knowledge gaps I may have.

Pratically everything in this repo has been done by following the course, the only exception being the usage of bootstrap.

During the course the instructor asks to install and use Boostrap version 3, I decided to go with version 4 instead and adapt what he implements using version 3 in version 4, so that this can just help me play around and familiarize a bit more with boostrap (css framework which I am only vaguely familiar with).
